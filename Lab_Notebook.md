# Lab Notebook ECE 445

**18th January 2023**

Today we brainstormed many ideas. Some that we talked about today were :
- Checking how smelly your shoes are
- Smart showerhead
- Trash Collection Idea

We ended up deciding to explore the trash collection idea more and Manav made a post on the webboard to see what the trash collection idea. The follwing is the post that we ended up making for the same :

> Just an idea I was thinking about was that what if we had like a funnel kind of thing that basically moves around and even when people throw trash it always catches it by moving around and then stores the trash underground for future trash collection. This way making sure there is not mess around the trash can and then can be later picked up based off of sensors letting the garbagemen know that is full.

We recieved a bunch of feedback on the same and were feeling less confident about the idea.



**19th January 2023**

After more discussion from the last post we decided to explore the smart showerhead again. After more thinking we realized that the idea could be better if we created a device that can be attached to any showerhead and measure a bunchh of stuff. Bhavana then made the following post:

> My idea centers around water retention for use in showers. There would be a device that could fit onto any type of shower head you had installed in your bathroom, and it could monitor the amount of water let out every minute. This could be useful in states or countries that are experiencing major drought in order to monitor home's total usage. Another feature that could be added to this device could be to add a temperature feature that monitors the temperature of the water instead of arbitrary ideas such as hot and cold. This way people can use a temperature that does not upset their scalp when they are washing their hair.

We then got more comments on our post and the TA liked the idea. After some more back and forth we decided that we should take another route where the showerhead could keep track of profiles and basically help people who share a shower.

We were feeling a lot more confident about the idea and decided to continue down this route.

**23rd January 2023**

We decided to create an RFA for the showerhead project idea on this day. Abhi and Manav created on outline for the systems and subsystems that we would need for this project. Once doing that, Bhavana helped to find many of the parts we would need in order to create each subsystem.

Once finishing this, we decided to submit the project on the web board in order to get it approved by the TA's and the professor.

**25th January 2023**

We decided to submit the RFA on the showerhead idea. We received responses from the TA and the professor in the next couple of days. One of the TA's, Akshatkumar Sanatbhai Sanghvi, said this regarding our project idea:

> Great. I think you could go for RFA.

With this we were feeling confident on our project idea. However, a little while later one of the professors also responded to our RFA with a less exciting response:

> I have serious doubts about the practicality of this device. A shower stall is a very hostile environment for electronics and any electrical device. A very high level of water resistance will be necessary. The presence of voltages and currents in a shower is potentially very hazardous. Where would the power to operate the systems come from? Certainly not household AC. Your system reminds me of an adjustable car seat with a memory feature which is convenient when there are multiple drivers. The difference is that the driver is belted into the seat and can't move whereas the person in the shower has quite a lot of freedom of movement so it is not necessary for the shower to aim accurately.
On the other hand, just implementing your smart shower head seems quite challenging even in a non-shower environment. I'm going to approve this project but you will have address safety and the water environment and how the device is truly more convenient than the standard shower head. Many shower heads have multiple setting for different types of flow. You might consider that.

With this, we were feeling a lot less confident about our project idea.

**31st January 2023**

Our group had a conversation today regarding what the professor had said about our project idea. We decided to take the Professor's advice regarding the adjustable showerhead and change that idea. He mentioned great points in the fact that an adjustable shower head is not as convenient as the user would be moving around a lot as compared to having an adjustable car seat in which the user would only be in that. Instead we wanted to have just a smart shower that would allow the user to check the temperature and the duration of the shower.

However, upon researching shower heads on the market, we realized that our idea already exists. As a result, we had to come up with a new way in which our idea could be different but still difficult to implement and interesting for a potential person.

**1st February 2023**

Our group met up again in order to flesh out a new feature we could add to our shower head that would make it different. After brainstorming, something that we noticed we all did when taking showers was listening to music. However, some of the problems we all faced when listening to music while showering was that we could not bring our phones into the shower as they would get wet. In this case, we decided to have a speaker in our system that could connect to a user's phone and allow them to play music while not harming the functionality of their phone.

After this, we decided to pitch our new and improved idea to our Project section on Pace in order to get confirmation from the TA's and professors that this would be a better idea: 

> Hi,
We wanted to make the project a little different if that is possible. We would like to get rid of the positioning feature based on the user's height. Instead, we would like to include a bluetooth speaker on the showerhead that can connect to your phone. With this, you can play whatever music/podcast you would like to listen to as you shower and control it from the showerhead itself without having your phone involved.
With this, you could skip, rewind, pause, or change the volume for the playlist that you are currently listening to directly on the showerhead. This minimizes the risk of your phone getting damaged while changing music in the shower.
This will make our showerhead different than the already available temperature setting showerheads while implementing a new feature for people.
Additionally, considering the powering of the system, we would have to create a waterproof box in which no water could potentially touch. This is one of the hardest parts of our project, but we believe we can make it work.
Please let us know if this project idea sounds viable and can be approved. Would we need to create another RFA for this to get approved, or could we make the project proposal straight away?

However, our post was met with no response. Believing that this was a better idea than our proposed RFA solution, we decided to go ahead and make a proposal for our new fleshed out idea.

**4th February 2023**

Our team decided to meet up today in order to talk about our project proposal that was due later that week on the 10th. From here, Manav started out by creating the problem and solution that our project would be solving. Bhavana started by creating the block diagram, the visual aid, and the safety considerations. And Abhijun started creating the tolerance analysis, the high level requirements, and talking to the machine shop in order to see if our project was even feasible.

After splitting up the work, we decided to meet back again later for our TA meeting.

**7th February 2023** 

Today we met with our TA, Akshatkumar Sanghvi, in order to talk about our project and go through our initial project proposal document with him. Upon meeting with him, he told us that everything looks good at the current moment but we need to make sure we are formatting our proposal in a way that is readable and similar to past projects. 

Our TA sent us a past proposal that received a great score in order to give us an understanding of how a good project proposal looks. With this, we were able to change our proposal to look similar to the one that received a good score in the next coming days.

**9th February 2023**

Today we sent in the project proposal. We all made finishing touches to our parts of the project and submitted it.

We also went to the machine shop and again talked about the feasibility of our project. We showed him the temperature and optical level liquid sensor that we were going to order. He said that he had never worked with them before, but after explaining how it works and how the tip is the only thing that needs to touch the water, he was able to visualize it in his head. With this, he told us that we can order the parts and the showerhead and bring him our items as soon as possible.

**15th February 2023** 

Today our group met up in order to research and order parts for our project. Bhavana ordered the showerhead and the optical level liquid sensor that we will use for our project. With this we would be able to drill a hole into the showerhead and put the optical sensor in to check the duration of the shower. 

We also were able to order a temperature sensor at this time. Abhijun did some research and found a temperature sensor that also detected the humidity of the surrounding area. Once ordering these parts, we are able to test the sensors to make sure they work and then go to the machine shop and give them the parts in order to create our design.

**16th February 2023**

Today we met in order to decide how to split up the design document information. We decided that Bhavana would take the requirements and verifications for the showerhead systems, Abhi would take the requirements and verifications for the remote systems, and Manav would take the cost analysis, the timeline, and improving the tolerance analysis and the safety requirements.

**17th February 2023**

Today our group met in order to order our Raspberry PI to use as a communication device between our remote and our shower head system. However, upon researching Raspberry PI's and talking to the people in the ECEB shop, we realized that a Raspberry PI would be a very expensive option for us. Most Raspberry PI's are very difficult to find on the market currently, so they have upped the price and they are selling for upwards of $100. This was not a feasible option for us as it would make us way above budget.

After talking to the people at the ECEB shop and doing some of our own research, we were able to find an alternate solution to our Raspberry PI problem. This solution was to get a device similar to the Raspberry PI, the Libre Computer.

We also emailed our TA regarding the grade for our project proposal as it was not done yet. All the other teams had received a grade and he had said he had graded all of them. However, we had not received a grade or feedback regarding our work so we could not fix it or change it for the design document if necessary. He said he would grade it as soon as possible.

**21st February 2023**

Today, we signed up for our design document review time. We decided to do it on 2/28/2023 at 3:30 pm as that was the time we were all available. In the meantime we have to get ready for the design review and finish our design document.

**22nd February 2023**

Today, we received an email from our TA regarding changes we should make to the project proposal; however, he still did not provide us with a grade at this time. Some of his feedback included changing our entire visual aid and block diagram as it was very confusing.

He also gave us the advice that we should add math to our tolerance analysis as it was a requirement.

However, as the design document was due the next day, we asked for an extension on the design document and the project proposal revision. Our TA said the professor would not approve the extension if we could get our design document done in time, so we buckled down and did majority of the work. 

Bhavana worked on redoing the block diagram and the visual aid using Microsoft Visio. Abhijun worked on adding math to our tolerance analysis. Manav worked on the other parts of the design document that were do as a result. 

At the end of the day, we were able to have a new block diagram, visual aid, and math in our tolerance analysis.

**23rd February 2023**

The design document was due. We formatted the entire document well and added all of our requirement and verifications table as well as doing a cost analysis on our project.

**24th February 2023**

We had a project proposal revision due. We used a lot of the information we made in the design document in order to enhance our project proposal revision. However we did not submit it as the professor said we would have 2 weeks upon receiving our grade in order to resubmit. So we decided to wait for our design document review to get feedback and resubmit it.

Our team contract was also due today. So we met up for a while and discussed how we would like to divide up the work and how we would handle conflict within the group. We also discussed which roles we would all like to have in the group and who would be in charge of what activity.

We all then signed the team contract and submitted it.

**27th February 2023**

Abhijun attended his peer review session and from this he was able to give information on what kinds of questions we should be prepared for regarding our design. Specifically questions regarding the voltage requirements and what to do if there was an issue in our voltage and current requirements.

**28th February 2023**

Today is the day of of our design document review. We got to the lab 5 minutes early in order to set up all of our laptops and make sure we knew who was saying what. When we presented we got many questions regarding our design and what kind of microcontroller we were using.

They also questioned the need for our Raspberry PI in the project. With this, we were very unsure other about why we were using it other than the fact that it has bluetooth capabilities and we would be able to use that to connect the phone to the speaker and the remote in order to change the song from the remote itself.

The professor also told us when looking at the cost analysis that we undervalued our workload and that we should give more to ourselves in wages. He also said that the 50 hours that we estimated for each of us to work would not be accurate and that we needed to add more hours in order to get this project to work.

At the end of this, Manav went to his peer review session and was able to see another project.

**1st March 2023** 

Bhavana went to her peer review session today.
