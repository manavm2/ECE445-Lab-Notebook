# Lab Notebook ECE 445

**18th January 2023**

Today we brainstormed many ideas. Some that we talked about today were :
- Checking how smelly your shoes are
- Smart showerhead
- Trash Collection Idea

We ended up deciding to explore the trash collection idea more and Manav made a post on the webboard to see what the trash collection idea. The follwing is the post that we ended up making for the same :

> Just an idea I was thinking about was that what if we had like a funnel kind of thing that basically moves around and even when people throw trash it always catches it by moving around and then stores the trash underground for future trash collection. This way making sure there is not mess around the trash can and then can be later picked up based off of sensors letting the garbagemen know that is full.

We recieved a bunch of feedback on the same and were feeling less confident about the idea.

After more discussion from the last post we decided to explore the smart showerhead again. After more thinking we realized that the idea could be better if we created a device that can be attached to any showerhead and measure a bunchh of stuff. Bhavana then made the following post:

> My idea centers around water retention for use in showers. There would be a device that could fit onto any type of shower head you had installed in your bathroom, and it could monitor the amount of water let out every minute. This could be useful in states or countries that are experiencing major drought in order to monitor home's total usage. Another feature that could be added to this device could be to add a temperature feature that monitors the temperature of the water instead of arbitrary ideas such as hot and cold. This way people can use a temperature that does not upset their scalp when they are washing their hair.

We then got more comments on our post and the TA liked the idea. After some more back and forth we decided that we should take another route where the showerhead could keep track of profiles and basically help people who share a shower.

We were feeling a lot more confident about the idea and decided to continue down this route.

We decided to create an RFA for the showerhead project idea on this day. Abhi and Manav created on outline for the systems and subsystems that we would need for this project. Once doing that, Bhavana helped to find many of the parts we would need in order to create each subsystem.

Once finishing this, we decided to submit the project on the web board in order to get it approved by the TA's and the professor.

We decided to submit the RFA on the showerhead idea. We received responses from the TA and the professor in the next couple of days. One of the TA's, Akshatkumar Sanatbhai Sanghvi, said this regarding our project idea:

> Great. I think you could go for RFA.
With this we were feeling confident on our project idea. However, a little while later one of the professors also responded to our RFA with a less exciting response:

> I have serious doubts about the practicality of this device. A shower stall is a very hostile environment for electronics and any electrical device. A very high level of water resistance will be necessary. The presence of voltages and currents in a shower is potentially very hazardous. Where would the power to operate the systems come from? Certainly not household AC. Your system reminds me of an adjustable car seat with a memory feature which is convenient when there are multiple drivers. The difference is that the driver is belted into the seat and can't move whereas the person in the shower has quite a lot of freedom of movement so it is not necessary for the shower to aim accurately.
On the other hand, just implementing your smart shower head seems quite challenging even in a non-shower environment. I'm going to approve this project but you will have address safety and the water environment and how the device is truly more convenient than the standard shower head. Many shower heads have multiple setting for different types of flow. You might consider that.

With this, we were feeling a lot less confident about our project idea.

Our group had a conversation today regarding what the professor had said about our project idea.
